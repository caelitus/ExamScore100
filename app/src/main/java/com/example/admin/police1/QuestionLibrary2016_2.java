For example, when someone asserts that China will soon overtake the United States as the dominant country in the world, this assertion should be met with the challenge, “Why do you say such a thing?” The person's reasons may be either strong or weak, but you will not know until you have asked the question and identified the reasons. If the answer is “because I think so,” you should be dissatisfied with the argument because the “reason” is a mere statement of the conclusion. However, if the answer is evidence concerning the projected military and educational expenditures of the two countries, you will consider such evidence when you evaluate the conclusion.",

                    "\n\n\n Some species seem to have a stronger influence than others on their ecosystem. Take away the sea stars along the northwest coast of the United States, for instance, and the ecosystem changes dramatically; in the absence of these sea stars, their favorite prey, mussels, takes over and makes it hard for other species that used to live there. Sea stars are known as keystone species, because as top predators they determine ecosystem structure by their eating habits. If you chop down an aspen tree by a beaver pond, not much will happen; but if you take away a beaver, a wetland might dry out, changing the kinds of plants that live there and the animals that rely on them. Because beavers exert their influence by physically altering the landscape, they are known as ecosystem engineers. ",

She never lost an election after that. She became Secretary of State of Connecticut, and then served two terms in the U.S. Congress. She was elected governor in 1974, the nation's first woman to be elected state governor. She was elected again for a second term in 1978, and worked to meet the needs of working people until she had to leave office in 1980 because of ill health.

Patents also allow a person to own the idea for a not-yet-completed invention.
