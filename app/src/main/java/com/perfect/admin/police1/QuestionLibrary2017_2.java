Such communities‚ usually called utopian communities‚ have been proposed in many generations of our history. These utopian communities never survive‚ but they serve as beacons for social change‚ reminding us that what exists is not permanent - society is built by humans, and it can therefore be (          ) by them.",

Modern criminologists regard society itself to be largely responsible for the crimes committed against it. Poverty‚ poor living conditions‚ and inadequate education are all causes of crime. Crime is fundamentally the result of society's failure to provide a decent life for all people. It is especially common in times when values are changing‚ as after a war‚ or in countries where people with different backgrounds and values are thrown together.",

A person might never rob a bank‚ but he or she may download pirated media. Korea has its fair share of copyright infringement problems. Until recently‚ copyright laws in Korea were lax. Further‚ high-speed internet is widely available. Faster download speeds are accelerating the problem. As a result‚ illegal downloads have been common. There are even online clubs dedicated to illegal file sharing. Their members pay a low monthly fee. In Korea‚ Korean and foreign television programs are easily available online. Music files are also shared. Movies can be seen even before they are released in theaters. It may not be legal‚ but it is simple and inexpensive. Many people are not even aware that file sharing is illegal.",

In the earliest experiment designed to test (  ㉠  )‚ an influential researcher made up two words‚ mal and mil. He told five hundred subjects that one word meant “large table‚” the other “small table” - and then asked the subjects to tell which word referred to which size table. By the laws of chance‚ the subjects should have chosen one word or the other in approximately equal numbers; (  ㉡  )‚ 80 percent of them agreed that mal meant “large table” and mil meant “small table.” Since the two words differ solely in their vowels, the subjects apparently felt that a conveys largeness and i smallness.",

The act of teaching is looked upon as a flow of knowledge from a higher source to an empty container. The student's role is one of receiving information; the teacher's role is one of sending it. There is a clear distinction assumed between one who is supposed to know and another‚ usually younger person who is supposed not to know. However‚ teaching need not be the province of a special group of people nor need it be looked upon as a technical skill. Teaching can be more like guiding and assisting than forcing information into a supposedly empty head. If you have a certain skill‚ you should be able to share it with someone. You do not have to get certified to convey what you know to someone else. All of us‚ from the very youngest children to the oldest members of our cultures‚ should come to realize our own potential as teachers.",
